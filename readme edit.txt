Overview
Introduction

We love Programming. Our aim with this course is to create a love for Programming.

Java is one of the most popular programming languages. Java offers both object oriented and functional programming features.

We take an hands-on approach using a combination of JShell(An awesome new feature in Java 9) and Eclipse as an IDE to illustrate more than 200 Java Coding Exercises, Puzzles and Code Examples.

In more than 250 Steps, we explore the most important Java Programming Language Features

    Basics of Java Programming - Expressions, Variables and Printing Output
    Java Operators - Java Assignment Operator, Relational and Logical Operators, Short Circuit Operators
    Java Conditionals and If Statement
    Methods - Parameters, Arguments and Return Values
    An Overview Of Java Platform - java, javac, bytecode, JVM and Platform Independence - JDK vs JRE vs JVM
    Object Oriented Programming - Class, Object, State and Behavior
    Basics of OOPS - Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance and Polymorphism
    Basics about Java Data Types - Casting, Operators and More
    Java Built in Classes - BigDecimal, String, Java Wrapper Classes
    Conditionals with Java - If Else Statement, Nested If Else, Java Switch Statement, Java Ternary Operator
    Loops - For Loop, While Loop in Java, Do While Loop, Break and Continue
    Immutablity of Java Wrapper Classes, String and BigDecimal
    Java Dates - Introduction to LocalDate, LocalTime and LocalDateTime
    Java Array and ArrayList - Java String Arrays, Arrays of Objects, Primitive Data Types, toString and Exceptions
    Introduction to Variable Arguments
    Basics of Designing a Class - Class, Object, State and Behavior. Deciding State and Constructors.
    Understanding Object Composition and Inheritance
    Java Abstract Class and Interfaces. Introduction to Polymorphism.
    Java Collections - List Interface(ArrayList, LinkedList and Vector), Set Interface (HashSet, LinkedHashSet and TreeSet), Queue Interface (PriorityQueue) and Map Interface (HashMap, HashTable, LinkedHashMap and TreeMap() - Compare, Contrast and Choose
    Generics - Why do we need Generics? Restrictions with extends and Generic Methods, WildCards - Upper Bound and Lower Bound.
    Functional Programming - Lambda Expression, Stream and Operations on a Stream (Intermediate Operations - Sort, Distinct, Filter, Map and Terminal Operations - max, min, collect to List), Functional Interfaces - Predicate Interface,Consumer Interface, Function Inteface for Mapping, Method References - static and instance methods
    Introduction to Threads and MultiThreading - Need for Threads
    Implementing Threads - Extending Thread Class and Implementing Runnable Interface
    States of a Thread and Communication between Threads
    Introduction to Executor Service - Customizing number of Active Threads. Returning a Future, invokeAll and invokeAny
    Introduction to Exception Handling - Your Thought Process during Exception Handling. try, catch and finally. Exception Hierarchy - Checked Exceptions vs Unchecked Exceptions. Throwing an Exception. Creating and Throwing a Custom Exception - CurrenciesDoNotMatchException. Try with Resources - New Feature in Java 7.
    List files and folders in Directory with Files list method, File walk method and find methods. Read and write from a File.
