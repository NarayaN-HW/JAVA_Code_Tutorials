<h2 align="left">Learn Java Programming in 1 Months.</h2>

Java is a widely-used programming language for coding web applications. It has been a popular choice among developers for over two decades, with millions of Java applications in use today. Java is a multi-platform, object-oriented, and network-centric language that can be used as a platform in itself.

Java is regarded as the most common ethical hacking language that ethical hackers use. In fact, it is also one of the most widely used programming languages globally. Java is an object-oriented, class-based programming language for enterprise software, application development and scientific computing applications. Extensive use of Java is evident in programming hardware devices, data analytics, server-side technologies, etc. 

The programming language is highly reliable for ethical hacking and tracking future risks, making it a leading one. Since it is a cross-platform programming language, ethical hackers deploy Java on different operating systems, including Linux, Windows and Mac. For developing hacking programmes for Android, having knowledge of Java is mandatory. 

There is a majority of companies such as, Uber, Pinterest, Google, Instagram, Spotify, Netflix, Airbnb, NASA Word Wind etc.
